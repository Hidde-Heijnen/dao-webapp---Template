 * Skeleton component to be used as a placeholder while content is loading.
 * As this uses `bg-popover`, it is recommended to use this inside of a Card component (or MainCard) that uses the default variant, and therefore has `bg-highlight`.
 * @warning This should not be used in place of rendering a Card component, as you can pass a loading state to the Card component itself.
 * @returns A div that pulses slowly to indicate a loading state.
